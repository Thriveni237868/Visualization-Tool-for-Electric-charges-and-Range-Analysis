Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming popular due to environmental benefits. However, EV users often worry about battery charge, driving range, and charging efficiency. This project aims to develop an interactive visualization tool that analyzes EV battery charge levels, energy consumption, and driving range using real-world or simulated data.
The tool will help users understand how factors such as speed, distance, battery capacity, and charging time affect the vehicle’s range and performance.
