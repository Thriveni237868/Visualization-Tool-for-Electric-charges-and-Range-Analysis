*. Objectives
• Analyze EV battery charge and discharge patterns
• Visualize driving range based on battery level
• Monitor charging time and efficiency
• Predict remaining driving range using data analysis
• Build interactive dashboards for easy understanding
*. Problem Statement
EV users face uncertainty about:
• How far they can travel with current battery charge
• How charging affects battery performance
• How driving conditions affect energy consumption
This project solves these problems using data visualization and analysis.
